Exploratory Data Analysis on IRIS and Haber-man Data set


This is the very first data analysis I do on my own. Please take the informations on this notebook with a grain of salt.

The purpose of this EDA is to find insights which will serve us later in another notebook for Data cleaning/preparation/transformation which will ultimately be used into a machine learning algorithm.
