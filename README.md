Exploratory Data Analysis on IRIS and Haber-man Data set


This is the very first data analysis I do on my own. Please take the informations on this notebook with a grain of salt.

The purpose of this EDA is to find insights which will serve us later in another notebook for Data cleaning/preparation/transformation which will ultimately be used into a machine learning algorithm.

I have worked on two toy dataset to learn Exploratory Data Analysis.

Below is the overview of each.
1. Iris Dataset -The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis

2. Haber_Man Survival data set-Haberman’s data set contains data from the study conducted in University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital between year 1958 to 1970 for the patients who undergone surgery of breast cancer.

I have perform various EDA techniques using python which are given below:-
1. Introduction to dataset
2. 1D ,2D and 3D scatter plot
3. Pair plots
4. Histogram
5. Introduction of PDF(Probability Density Function)
6. Introduction of CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)
7. Mean, Variance and Standard Deviation
8. Median and Quantiles
9. Box-plot and whisker
Violin Plots
